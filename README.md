# FileSort

FileSort organizes large collection of unsorted photos.

Digital photography makes it easy to take and retake a shot until it's
"just right". But the more photos you take, the harder it gets to keep
your "digital darkroom" in good order!

`FileSort` is a simple utility script that I wrote as part of Stanford
University's 'Code In Place' online learning course. You can pass a
folder of photos to `FileSort` and it will help order your collection.
Right now, ordering is strictly by date, but I'm intending to add other
sort options over time.

## Usage

`FileSort` requires [Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

From the command line, run `python3 file_sort.py` and respond to the
prompts.

Press "Q" or "q" to quit at any time.
